// Step 1: Take a sentence of at least five words and a period
let sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over.";
console.log('Sentence:', sentence);

// Step 2: Make an array from that sentence
let wordsArray = sentence.split(' ');
console.log('Array of words:', wordsArray);

// Step 3: Console.log the third word
let thirdWord = wordsArray[2];
console.log('Third word:', thirdWord);
